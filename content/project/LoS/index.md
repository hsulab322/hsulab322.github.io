In this project we use the Fechner method (of taking the limit of sequence of integrals of jnd’s) to construct the scales in a (weakly balanced) affine representation. We postulate a psychophysical law of similarity, and study its impact on the possible functional forms in the affine representation. Under this framework we further study the conditions under which affine representations are also Fechnerian, and link the results to the solutions in Iverson (2006) that was worked out within the Fechnerian framework. The work of this project has been summarized in a paper titled “Conditions under which affine representations are also Fechnerian under the power law of similarity on the Weber sensitivities” to be published in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology (see the attached file).

我們採用一藉區辨極限及差異閾積分建構心理物理量尺的「費區納法」，探究心理物理「仿射表徵」之量尺性質。我們假設一心理物理「相似律」，探討在此同質性假設下，仿射表徵的量尺函數形式。我們並探究在此框設下，仿射表徵可簡化為費區納表徵的條件，並討論其與Iverson (2006) 於費區納表徵下所得之結果的關聯。本研究成果已寫成論文 ”Conditions under which affine representations are also Fechnerian under the power law of similarity on the Weber sensitivities”，且即將發表於Journal of Mathematical Psychology期刊（見附文）。
