Hsu's lab is always open to students.

We are concerned about these issues:

1. Using threshold theory to model psychometric functions with response confidence
2. Use of adaptive methods with response confidence in psychophysical experiments
3. Feedback-based decision making and reward prediction error
4. The representational measurement approach to (theoretical) psychophysics
5. A stochastic semiorder approach to paneled attitudinal thermometer data
