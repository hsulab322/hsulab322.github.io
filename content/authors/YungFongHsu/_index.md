Professor Yung-Fong Hsu’s specialty is Quantitative Psychology, particularly the application of algebraic and probabilistic modeling to decision analysis across different disciplines in the behavioral sciences. In the past few years, he has accomplished research in several topics. First, he has participated in a series of studies concerning prediction errors in reward-based decision making using behavioral, model-fitting, and electrophysiological approaches. The results contribute to our understanding of the role of prediction errors in belief formation and belief perseveration, providing convergent evidence toward a unified theory to explain, e.g., aberrant behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Second, he has studied the homogeneity law within Fechnerian psychophysics. The results contribute to our understanding of the interplay of Weber-function related empirical regularity and extensions of the Fechnerian representation that can be used to characterize a large family of models of discrimination probabilities. Third, he has been involved in developing stochastic process models of preference change for paneled attitudinal data. A closely related work concerning the measurement issue of thermometer ratings and Likert scales was discussed from the meaningfulness viewpoint, and a semiorder-based model was developed. Fourth, he has done some work concerning the role of response confidence in threshold estimation in psychophysics. The work helps lead to the development of an alternative response-confidence embedded algorithm. Recently, he has been involved in a project that explores the role of emotion during the conflict of dual processing (heuristic vs. analytic) in decision making using multimodal approaches (including behavioral, PET-fMRI and MRS-fMRI).
