 abstract = {It is known that sequence learning involves attention-modulated implicit and/or explicit processes (Nissen and Bullemer, 1987). The pure perceptual-based sequence learning task (Remillard, 2009) which employs the probabilistic structure of visual stimulus, has demonstrated that visual-spatial attention could affect sequence learning. But that task did not specify the kinds of attention responsible for the impairment of sequence learning. Caparos and Linnell (2009) indicated that there is a gradient effect of attention under low perceptual load. The closer the distractor is to the target, the more the attention is consumed. This study used distractors from high- and low-successive frequencies and manipulated two attentional factors, namely distance and randomness, to investigate their impact on perceptual-based learning. Remillard’s paradigm (2009) is employed and the results was replicated. In the second experiment, the various distances of distractors to the targets were manipulated, and the results revealed that only the short-same-color distraction group impaired learning, and the others did not. This result supports the visual-spatial attention account. In the last experiment, the randomness of distractors to the targets was manipulated, and the results revealed that the random-long-same-color distraction group impaired learning. This result supports the attention-independent associative account. The three experiments indicated that perceptual-based sequence learning is affected differently by the characters of attention in the different condition.
序列學習（sequence learning）(Nissen & Bullemer, 1987）研究在過去一直有顯式、隱式兩種不同歷程的解釋；而其作業測量結果也受刺激結構及不同注意力影響。純知覺基礎序列學習（pure perceptual-based sequence learning）(Remillard, 2009）作業操弄機率型刺激結構，其研究結果藉由排除其它注意力假說，而支持該作業結果受視空間注意力所影響。Caparos與Linnell (2009) 認為視空間注意力在低知覺負荷下，其干擾物對注意力的影響會有階梯（gradient）性效應；干擾物離目標物越近，越消耗注意力。有鑑於此，本研究首先操弄干擾物與目標物的距離差異，再操弄干擾物的隨機程度差異，藉以探討不同注意力變項對知覺序列學習作業的影響。實驗一採用Remillard (2009) 的作業派典，其結果發現，在同顏色組沒有發生隱式序列學習，而在不同顏色組則發生隱式序列學習，複驗了過去的研究。實驗二操弄同顏色干擾物的長、短距離，發現在短距離-同顏色干擾物組沒有發生隱式序列學習，而在長距離-同顏色干擾物組有發生隱式序列學習。此結果說明不同距離對知覺序列學習作業有影響，支持視空間注意力假說。實驗三操弄長距離-同顏色干擾物的隨機位置，發現沒有發生隱式序列學習。此結果說明關聯性注意力對知覺序列學習作業也有影響。本篇研究說明純知覺基礎序列學習作業的隱式序列學習表現，在不同條件下會受到不同注意力的影響。},
