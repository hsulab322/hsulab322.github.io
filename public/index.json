The advantage of linear models is that they are flexible and can be used for inference across many disciplines. They are, however, often poor models of cognitive and psychological processes. For example, researchers may be interested in assessing the roles of storage and retrieval processes in a memory task. The relationship between storage and retrieval is surely not linear.\nThis course is about a different class of models for psychology. Two main paths of cognitive modeling have evolved in mathematical psychology, depending on how we deal with the \u0026lsquo;black box.\u0026rsquo; One path of modeling is concerned with uncovering the structure within the black box; it aims to provide detailed, substantive, and formal accounts of specific mental processes. The other path of modeling focuses on capturing the properties of the black box by the mathematical model; it aims to provide the representation that might characterize a large family of processing models. This course is designed to cover a limited number of models from both paths. In doing so, important general concepts in modeling are introduced.\nOne of the goals is to teach students a unified principle for all statistics: likelihood. We will show you how to write down likelihoods of various models and how to use computational techniques to maximize likelihood. We will also mention issues on model selection based on nested likelihood and others. Moreover, since simulation can help developing insight about how models account for phenomena, we will use simulations in this regard from time to time.\nTo summarize, in this course we will introduce some mathematical modeling approaches in psychology. We first review some basic concepts of probability and random variables. We then introduce the concept of maximum likelihood, a model-fitting approach commonly used in mathematical psychology. In the second part of the course we illustrate the use of mathematical methods with examples from psychophysics. Several applications of mathematical modeling also will be introduced. Topics include signal detection theory, threshold models, multinomial processing tree models, etc.\nWe will use R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that can be downloaded from the web page http://www.r-project.org/, for some of the homework problems.\nNote  限本系大三以上學生,大二或外系校生需經老師同意。需同時選修心理學資料處理-以R為例 總人數上限：10人 如果你有興趣修此門課但未能選上，請勿缺席第一堂課，我們會視情況更改修課人數上限  ","date":1611446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1611446400,"objectID":"1d7ca98f527e8026a16db675b6835ae3","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/courses/math-method/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/math-method/","section":"courses","summary":"An example of using Wowchemy's Book layout for publishing online courses.","tags":null,"title":"Mathematical Methods in Psychology","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Build a foundation in Python.\n  1-2 hours per week, for 8 weeks\nLearn   Quiz What is the difference between lists and tuples?

We mainly focus on the consequences of applying Shannon’s (1948) entropy to Likert-type scale. From the previous debate, we extend and summarize two severe defects of the entropy-based emodiversity index: (a) calculating probability from Likert-type scale is mathematically unjustifiable; (b) there is extremely high collinearity between the entropy index and richness when the emotion measurement has limited range, which usually occurs in empirical studies. We also collected data (N = 962) and analyzed the entropy scores for positive and negative affect under 5-point scale with different numbers of items (5-, 10-, and 20-item).

We mainly focus on the consequences of applying Shannon’s (1948) entropy to Likert-type scale. From the previous debate, we extend and summarize two severe defects of the entropy-based emodiversity index: (a) calculating probability from Likert-type scale is mathematically unjustifiable; (b) there is extremely high collinearity between the entropy index and richness when the emotion measurement has limited range, which usually occurs in empirical studies. We also collected data (N = 962) and analyzed the entropy scores for positive and negative affect under 5-point scale with different numbers of items (5-, 10-, and 20-item). The results showed that under 5-point scale Quoidbach et al.’s index is strongly correlated with richness (rs ranged from .94 to .98) and that the variation of their index can be simply explained by the linear combination of mean, relative standard deviation, and their interaction term (R2s ranged from .78 to .92).

The CCT methodology originally aims at analyzing data consisting of binary (true/false or yes/no) responses to interview questions within a culturally-related context. Later work by Batchelder and colleagues extended CCT to account for the ordinal categorical data type (e.g., the Likert-type questionnaires). In this project we develop an alternative approach to CCT modeling for the ordinal categorical data type. Specifically, we incorporate a response-confidence embedded threshold theory into the CCT framework. We systematically evaluate the fit of the model by hierarchical Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and the results will be discussed.\n「文化共識理論」是一以認知模式為本之分析方法，由學者Batchelder及其同事於 1980年代發展出。此方法旨在分析群組人士在文化影響下對於某些知識或意見之共識，特別是當正確答案屬未知狀態。此方法最初發展僅限用於文化情境底下二分回答選項之資料，爾後Batchelder及其同事結合信號偵測理論及測驗理論的一些元素，將之延伸至可處理排序型類別資料(包括李克特量表)。本研究在「文化共識理論」架構下提出另一路徑，發展一結合反應信心於閾值理論的分析方法處理排序型類別資料。我們藉電腦模擬評估此法之可行性，特別是，我們採階層式貝氏統計法，透過馬可夫鏈蒙地卡羅法進行參數估計。\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"068d1dc840d45ebd74fb1e8bef83e9fd","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/project/ltcm/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ltcm/","section":"project","summary":"本研究於「文化共識理論」架構下發展一結合反應信心於閾值理論的分析方法處理文化情境下排序型類別資料(如：李克特量表資料)。","tags":["Cultural Consensus Theory","Threshold Theory","Bayesian","Response Confidence"],"title":"文化共識理論架構下的閾值理論延伸：排序型類別資料分析","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Following this idea, in this thesis I used simulation to survey the influence of introducing a continuous response confidence scale to different adaptive methods (including the Weighted Up-Down method, Biased Coin Design, and Derman''s Up-Down method) in two types of threshold experiments (Yes/No tasks and Same/Difference tasks). Moreover, I systematically manipulated the initial value, step size, trial number and other experiment variables to discuss their influences on adaptive methods.

However, after decades of research in the fields of social psychology, organizational psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, the mechanisms contributing to this pronounce impact is yet debating. To provide more formative indices to the existing descriptive models and to link them to more concrete neurophysiological substrates, we have examined the affective influences on decision making under the framework of reinforcement learning theory. Specifically, we followed the definition from Loewenstein and Lerner (2003) and examined the impacts of incidental and integral affects on reward-based decision making in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. In Study 1, the incidental affect or mood state was induced through introducing different facial expressions (i.e., neutral, angry, and happy) into a probabilistic gambling task. By contrast, in Study 2, the integral affect or emotional experience was elicited through manipulating different levels of perceived unfairness in a modified dictator game preceding a probabilistic gambling task. The choice behavior data from the probabilistic gambling task in the two studies were fit with a reinforcement learning model (Sutton \u0026 Barto, 1998; Li et al., 2014) to retrieve the parameters that help us to uncover the mental processes underlying decision making. Also, in each experimental condition, the concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) data were analyzed to retrieve the event-related potentials (ERP) that reflect the neural signaling of reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and actual action outcomes. In addition, the schizophrenic patients are characterized with deficient reward processing and attenuated affective response, and it is of interest to investigate the altered affective influence in this population. Hence, in Study 3, we modified the design of Study 1 and applied it to chronic schizophrenic patients. This is an exploratory research and we set to investigate the potential interaction between deficient reward processing and aberrant affective activity (i.e, expression recognition) in this population, as these two factors might contribute together to the disrupted social function and poor life quality in schizophrenia. Findings of this study shall contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying affect-elicited decision making in schizophrenia. 我們的日常生活中充滿著各種情緒活動經驗，而這些經驗通常都會為決策與判斷帶來深遠的影響。過去數十年間，各領域研究的研究者們中對於情緒化決策相關議題的探索累積了豐碩的研究成果，也提出了許多結構化分類與描述現象的理論架構，但這些現象背後的機制卻仍在爭議當中。為了替這些敘述性的理論提供更明確的量測指標，並且賦予具體的神經生理基礎，我們將對於情緒化決策歷程的探討連結到增強學習理論 (reinforcement learning theory; Sutton \u0026 Barto, 1998) 的架構之中，並依循 Loewenstein 與 Lerner (2003) 的定義將情緒活動區分成伴隨性情緒 (incidental affect) 與整合性情緒 (integral affect)，分別於研究一與研究二中探討兩種情緒活動對於酬賞基礎決策 (reward-based decision making) 歷程的影響。在研究一當中，我們以中性、生氣、與高興三種不同的臉孔表情做為促發刺激嵌入機率博弈作業 (probabilistic gambling task) 當中，操弄受試者在作業過程中的伴隨性情緒活動；而在研究二當中，我們則是安排受試者在進行機率博弈作業之前先參與一個修改過後的獨裁者遊戲，並於其中操弄不同程度的分配不公平性，以引發受試者間不同的整合性情緒經驗。受試者於機率博弈作業當中的選擇行為資料以增強學習模型 (Sutton \u0026 Barto, 1998; Li, Lai, Liu, \u0026 Hsu, 2014) 配適，藉此提取與決策判斷歷程有關的模型估計參數；而實驗過程中所記錄到的腦波活動資料 (electroencephalogram, EEG) 也分析提取成事件關聯電位 (event-related potential, ERP)，以反映酬賞預測誤差 (reward-prediction error, RPE)－預期結果與實際結果之間的差距－所引發的神經活動。綜合行為、模型參數估計、以及神經生理指標量測的結果，我們發現伴隨性情緒活動與整合性情緒經驗對決策歷程的影響不盡相同，並且分別對應到不同的現行理論架構，我們將其彙整討論於最後一章。另外，文獻指出思覺失調症 (schizophrenia) 患者在酬賞處理與情緒辨識上皆有著明顯缺損，然而兩者之間的關係卻鮮少被討論，於是在研究三中我們便將研究一的設計修改後應用於這群患者上。結果顯示，在酬賞處理與情緒辨識的異常表現之餘，患者們的情緒活動對於決策力將的調節效果也明顯低於健康對照組。結合過去文獻，我們主張情緒與決策共同反應著重要的社會功能面向，而對於情緒化決策缺損的探討可增進我們對思覺失調症患者社會功能障礙的了解。","tags":["affective influence","decision making","feedback-related negativity","reinforcement learning model","reward-prediction error","schizophrenia"],"title":"Affective influences on reward-based decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hong-Hsiang Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9da976399c6149407f4f52ef5126dd76","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/publication/liu-2018/","publishdate":"2022-04-20T15:44:59.820232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Affective experience pervades our daily life and it usually brings out pronounce impact on our judgment and decision making.

Also, in each experimental condition, the concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) data were analyzed to retrieve the event-related potentials (ERP) that reflect the neural signaling of reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and actual action outcomes. In addition, the schizophrenic patients are characterized with deficient reward processing and attenuated affective response, and it is of interest to investigate the altered affective influence in this population. Hence, in Study 3, we modified the design of Study 1 and applied it to chronic schizophrenic patients. This is an exploratory research and we set to investigate the potential interaction between deficient reward processing and aberrant affective activity (i.e, expression recognition) in this population, as these two factors might contribute together to the disrupted social function and poor life quality in schizophrenia. Findings of this study shall contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying affect-elicited decision making in schizophrenia. 我們的日常生活中充滿著各種情緒活動經驗，而這些經驗通常都會為決策與判斷帶來深遠的影響。過去數十年間，各領域研究的研究者們中對於情緒化決策相關議題的探索累積了豐碩的研究成果，也提出了許多結構化分類與描述現象的理論架構，但這些現象背後的機制卻仍在爭議當中。為了替這些敘述性的理論提供更明確的量測指標，並且賦予具體的神經生理基礎，我們將對於情緒化決策歷程的探討連結到增強學習理論 (reinforcement learning theory; Sutton \u0026 Barto, 1998) 的架構之中，並依循 Loewenstein 與 Lerner (2003) 的定義將情緒活動區分成伴隨性情緒 (incidental affect) 與整合性情緒 (integral affect)，分別於研究一與研究二中探討兩種情緒活動對於酬賞基礎決策 (reward-based decision making) 歷程的影響。在研究一當中，我們以中性、生氣、與高興三種不同的臉孔表情做為促發刺激嵌入機率博弈作業 (probabilistic gambling task) 當中，操弄受試者在作業過程中的伴隨性情緒活動；而在研究二當中，我們則是安排受試者在進行機率博弈作業之前先參與一個修改過後的獨裁者遊戲，並於其中操弄不同程度的分配不公平性，以引發受試者間不同的整合性情緒經驗。受試者於機率博弈作業當中的選擇行為資料以增強學習模型 (Sutton \u0026 Barto, 1998; Li, Lai, Liu, \u0026 Hsu, 2014) 配適，藉此提取與決策判斷歷程有關的模型估計參數；而實驗過程中所記錄到的腦波活動資料 (electroencephalogram, EEG) 也分析提取成事件關聯電位 (event-related potential, ERP)，以反映酬賞預測誤差 (reward-prediction error, RPE)－預期結果與實際結果之間的差距－所引發的神經活動。綜合行為、模型參數估計、以及神經生理指標量測的結果，我們發現伴隨性情緒活動與整合性情緒經驗對決策歷程的影響不盡相同，並且分別對應到不同的現行理論架構，我們將其彙整討論於最後一章。另外，文獻指出思覺失調症 (schizophrenia) 患者在酬賞處理與情緒辨識上皆有著明顯缺損，然而兩者之間的關係卻鮮少被討論，於是在研究三中我們便將研究一的設計修改後應用於這群患者上。結果顯示，在酬賞處理與情緒辨識的異常表現之餘，患者們的情緒活動對於決策力將的調節效果也明顯低於健康對照組。結合過去文獻，我們主張情緒與決策共同反應著重要的社會功能面向，而對於情緒化決策缺損的探討可增進我們對思覺失調症患者社會功能障礙的了解。","tags":["affective influence","decision making","feedback-related negativity","reinforcement learning model","reward-prediction error","schizophrenia"],"title":"Affective influences on reward-based decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yung-Fong Hsu"],"categories":null,"content":"This project concerns a theoretical study of psychophysics.

The current plan serves as the foundation for the study of individual differences, which include mostly research themes in intelligence, personality, and their psychometrically based measures and scales. However, some of the scales involved are not without debate, and there is a need for clarification from the measurement-theory viewpoint. On the other hand, over the past 30 years the development of human genetics has provided (the study of) individual differences with new interpretations, and discussions from behavior genetics about intelligence and personality often touch the issue of gene-environment interactions. Further, advances in neuroimaging and electro-physiology have brought new perspectives to this field. Also, adaptive (and computerized) measurement tools for evaluation have been becoming the mainstream, and the development seems to toward the goal of individualized assessments. Accordingly, this project aims to increase the book collections/volumes of the NTU library from three perspectives. They are (I) well-known books concerning theories of intelligence and of personality, (II) books on measurement theory and on psychometrics concerning testing, and (III) books on genetics and on neural mechanism concerning individual differences. Under this project, we have purchased a total of 3380 items, including books, CDs, and dissertations. The full list of collections is attached at the end of this report. The NTU library also has established a website for book sorting and searching under this project.

The work of this project has been summarized in a paper titled “Conditions under which affine representations are also Fechnerian under the power law of similarity on the Weber sensitivities” to be published in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology (see the attached file).\n我們採用一藉區辨極限及差異閾積分建構心理物理量尺的「費區納法」，探究心理物理「仿射表徵」之量尺性質。我們假設一心理物理「相似律」，探討在此同質性假設下，仿射表徵的量尺函數形式。我們並探究在此框設下，仿射表徵可簡化為費區納表徵的條件，並討論其與Iverson (2006) 於費區納表徵下所得之結果的關聯。本研究成果已寫成論文 ”Conditions under which affine representations are also Fechnerian under the power law of similarity on the Weber sensitivities”，且即將發表於Journal of Mathematical Psychology期刊（見附文）。\n","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"bcc0432914e8b732ce2cb693b71b73c0","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/project/los/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/los/","section":"project","summary":"我們假設一心理物理「相似律」，探討在此同質性假設下，仿射表徵的量尺函數形式。","tags":["Psychophysics","Threshold Theory","Fechnerian Representation","Functional Equation","Law of Similarity","Weber Sensitivity","Regular Variation"],"title":"心理物理學相似律與仿射表徵互動之探究","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yung-Fong Hsu","Christopher W.

In clinical settings the common approach to assess the functioning of memory is to take memory tests based on recall and recognition. However, such tests hardly reveal the underlying causes of memory degradation, because scores of these tests typically are not results of a single cognitive process but are influenced by several cognitive processes such as storage and retrieval. In this paper we introduce a cognitive modeling approach called ”multinomial processing tree models” to the clinical psychology community in Taiwan. This model assumes that the memory process consists of unstored, intermediate, and long-term states. The transition among the three states follows a discrete-state Markovian learning process, with the respective probabilities of storage and retrieval being characterized by some parameters. We illustrate the use of the model to clinical data collected from National Taiwan University Hospital, including Alzheimer's disease, early-onset dementia, senile dementia, mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, and organic brain syndrome.

In clinical settings the common approach to assess the functioning of memory is to take memory tests based on recall and recognition. However, such tests hardly reveal the underlying causes of memory degradation, because scores of these tests typically are not results of a single cognitive process but are influenced by several cognitive processes such as storage and retrieval. In this paper we introduce a cognitive modeling approach called ”multinomial processing tree models” to the clinical psychology community in Taiwan. This model assumes that the memory process consists of unstored, intermediate, and long-term states. The transition among the three states follows a discrete-state Markovian learning process, with the respective probabilities of storage and retrieval being characterized by some parameters. We illustrate the use of the model to clinical data collected from National Taiwan University Hospital, including Alzheimer's disease, early-onset dementia, senile dementia, mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, and organic brain syndrome. To assess the within-group heterogeneity commonly seen in clinical settings, we also incorporate a latent class analysis into the model. Parameter estimates via goodness-of-fit using the computer program HMMTree reveal that different types of dementia undergo somewhat differentiable deficits of storage and/or retrieval processes in the immediate and long-term states. We also discuss two limitations of the current study, namely the representativeness of the sample and the restriction of the HMMTree program.","tags":["失智症; 多項歷程樹狀模式; 阿茲海默症; 馬可夫學習歷程; 潛在類別分析; Alzheimer's disease; dementia; latent class analysis; Markovian learning process; multinomial processing tree model"],"title":"Assessing memory deficits using latent class (hierarchical) multinomial processing tree modeling: An illustration using data from clinical groups in Taiwan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yung-Fong Hsu"],"categories":null,"content":"決策之不確定性可歸因於個體對未來事件的訊息不足,或對內在偏好的游移(或兩者皆有)。同時,情緒調節認知,反之亦然。尤其與酬懲有關之決策亦伴隨情緒,此效應有時在非自我覺查的情況下也會產生。另外,決策分析易受情境因素(如回饋)影響,而回饋之內容亦易引發情緒。我們藉一 改良式「動態酬賞作業」,從預期錯誤角度探討與情緒調控有關之回饋型決策作業酬懲歷程,研究內容包括實證研究與模式探討兩部份\n","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"69aa25eb4d43d9d1c93af06a19b697ee","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/project/eerl/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/eerl/","section":"project","summary":"我們藉一 改良式「動態酬賞作業」,從預期錯誤角度探討與情緒調控有關之回饋型決策作業酬懲歷程。","tags":["Decision Making","Dynamic Reword Task","Expected Error","Reinforce Learning","Emotion"],"title":"從預期錯誤角度探討回饋型決策作業之酬懲歷程：實證研究與模式探討","type":"project"},{"authors":["Y.-C.

The two-alternative forced-choice paradigm is commonly used for the experiment. In this paradigm, participants have to choose the alternative that contains the target stimulus. Recently, some researchers conducted psychophysical experiments using non-parametric adaptive procedures that incorporate the confidence rating of responses from participants. The efficiency of thresholds and parameters estimations was enhanced by the confidence rating of responses (Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001; Garcia-Perez, 2010). In this thesis, the weighted up-down procedure, a non-parametric adaptive procedure, was used to conduct experiments. Two response tools - keyboard and visual analogue scale — and the confidence rating of two-, three-, and four-response options were used to collect responses, comparing the efficiency of discrimination threshold estimations among different options of the confidence rating. We also used a non-adaptive procedure to measure the thresholds and tested the consistency of threshold estimations between the non-adaptive and weighted up-down procedures. To conclude, threshold estimations by the weighted up-down procedure were biased compared to the estimations by the non-adaptive procedure. And this result was consistent with previous simulation studies. The results in the weighted up-down procedure showed that tasks with three-, and four-response options were more efficient methods on estimating thresholds than the task with the two-response option.

In particular, the updated reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and the actual rewards, is regarded as being encoded by dopamine neurons. Two issues about RPE were discussed in this thesis. First, dysfunction of RPE might link abnormal dopamine systems and therefore the formation of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucination and delusion) in schizophrenia (SZ). To examine this hypothesis, we tested SZ patients and healthy controls using a feedback-based “dynamic rewarding task,” in which the subject was required to choose between two different reward options that were alternated in a block fashion. We fit the experimental data with a (standard) reinforcement learning (RL) model using the Bayesian estimation approach. Model-fitting results revealed that SZ patients update their values more rapidly and have more exploratory decisions. We also found that the degree of exploration increases with the severity of the psychotic symptoms. These findings support the hypothesis that abnormal RPE processes correlate with aberrant dopaminergic activities and subjective psychotic experiences. Second, since an individual’s heritable trait might predispose her/his decision-making behavior, we conducted a Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire on subjects to investigate the correlation between personality traits and the estimated parameters in the RL model. Results showed that college students with higher novelty seeking scores have lower value-updating rates, and those with higher reward dependence scores have higher degree of explorations.

In particular, the updated reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and the actual rewards, is regarded as being encoded by dopamine neurons. Two issues about RPE were discussed in this thesis. First, dysfunction of RPE might link abnormal dopamine systems and therefore the formation of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucination and delusion) in schizophrenia (SZ). To examine this hypothesis, we tested SZ patients and healthy controls using a feedback-based “dynamic rewarding task,” in which the subject was required to choose between two different reward options that were alternated in a block fashion. We fit the experimental data with a (standard) reinforcement learning (RL) model using the Bayesian estimation approach. Model-fitting results revealed that SZ patients update their values more rapidly and have more exploratory decisions. We also found that the degree of exploration increases with the severity of the psychotic symptoms. These findings support the hypothesis that abnormal RPE processes correlate with aberrant dopaminergic activities and subjective psychotic experiences. Second, since an individual’s heritable trait might predispose her/his decision-making behavior, we conducted a Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire on subjects to investigate the correlation between personality traits and the estimated parameters in the RL model. Results showed that college students with higher novelty seeking scores have lower value-updating rates, and those with higher reward dependence scores have higher degree of explorations. Moreover, gender differences were found in the task performance. However, no similar patterns were found in SZ patients. Finally, we briefly discussed two modeling issues that are yet to be resolved. The first concerns the negative correlation between the learning rate parameter and the perseveration parameter in the RL model. The second concerns the issue of scale invariance with regard to the perseveration parameter in the RL model. 動物與人在不確定性環境中決策皆需經由試誤學習才能學習到環境的規則，對環境形成預期並依此作為未來決策的依據。根據增強學習理論的假設，預期的更新發生於預期與實際經驗之間有落差時，該落差被稱為酬賞預測誤差（reward prediction error, RPE）。當研究發現多巴胺細胞能夠記錄RPE訊號，RPE在神經科學的研究開始興起。本研究包含兩個議題，分別探討（i）精神分裂症病人（schizophrenia, SZ）的精神病症狀與RPE之關係，（ii）個體在性格上的差異是否影響RPE的處理歷程。首先，有學者認為多巴胺系統異常導致RPE處理錯誤是SZ病人產生精神病症狀（例如：幻覺與妄想）的原因。為檢驗該假設，本研究讓SZ病人進行以兩選項之機率學習的回饋性決策—動態酬賞作業，在作業中得到酬賞機率大的選項每過一段時間會改變，而且該改變不會告知受試者。本研究使用增強學習模型來分析資料，參數估計使用貝氏估計法。研究發現SZ病人更新預期的速度比較快且有較多探索性決策。此外，隨著病人的精神病症狀越嚴重，則會有越多的探索性決策。這些研究結果與假設相符。研究的第二部份分析Cloninger之三向度性格量表各向度得分與動態酬賞作業表現的相關，結果發現一般大學生在動態酬賞作業的表現存在性別差異，而且新奇追求傾向越高者其更新預期的速度越慢，酬賞依賴傾向越高者其探索性決策越多。然而，在SZ病人並無發現類似的結果。另外，本研究也約略討論增強學習模型的參數性質，包括參數間的相關性與單位不變性。","tags":["Bayesian estimation","psychosis","reinforcement learning model","reward prediction error","schizophrenia","Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire"],"title":"Reward prediction errors in reinforcement learning: Psychosis, personality, and modeling issues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ling-Ming Tseng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"78f001fbd2cc2df81f20695ac71dc4be","permalink":"https://hsulab.psy.ntu.edu.tw/publication/content/publication/tseng-2011/","publishdate":"2022-04-29T07:51:44.995295Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/tseng-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Feeling of Knowing (FOK) judgments refer to the feelings an individual has regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether or not that knowledge exists within memory.
