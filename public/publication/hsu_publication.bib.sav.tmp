  abstract = {How people make choices among alternatives are of interest in different areas of psychological research. One paradigm to answer this question is by applying Likert Scale (LS) to compare the agreements to different alternatives, and the respective LS scores are then transferred into rank order of preference. However, using LS to infer choices is somewhat debatable because the measurement format of LS was not designed for revealing psychological preference. In this article, we examined to what extent it is appropriate to use quantitative indicators derived from LS to infer choices, with which we used the Comparative Judgment (CJ) procedure to represent a direct measurement of choice decision to compare. A total of 929 adolescents reported their effort and ability attributions for academic failure and success using both LS and CJ. We found that while using LS is generally accurate in predicting results obtained via CJ, the percentage of people revealing different choices inferred from LS versus CJ was 14.7% and 12.1% for the success and failure scenarios, respectively, suggesting that inferring psychological preference from LS is not without risk, at least for this sample of adolescents from a culturally-Chinese society. Furthermore, the majority of participants displaying incongruent decisions of achievement attribution via LS and CJ showed equivalent LS scores between effort and ability attributions. A goodness-of-fit test was conducted (on a model motivated by the beta-binomial distribution) and successfully eliminated the possibility that the tied LS scores in effort and ability attributions actually represent participants’ true psychological state.},

This model, which has η(λ,s) and γ(λ,s) as parameters, is quite general and may be applied in a number of situations in psychophysics.

In the present work, we extend the analysis to the more general s=u(ξs(x))−w(x) and derive the forms for the scales u and w. We avoid the assumption of differentiability and replace it with an assumption either of nonconstancy or of dependence on only one input variable. We find that for some solutions, w has the same form as u, possibly with different parameters, while for other solutions, w takes a different form than u.

On the one hand, research on the bystander effect shows that a person gives less when givers outnumber recipients than if they are equal in number. On the other, studies of congestible altruism have found that a person gives more when recipients outnumber givers than if they are equal in size. An interesting question is whether giving decreases at a different rate when givers outnumber recipients than it increases the other way around. Answering the question helps illuminate whether the two effects of collective giving, which the literature has discussed separately, are governed by the same rule. We conducted a multi-person dictator game experiment to investigate people’s giving behavior in different group sizes of givers and recipients. We found that giving decreases more rapidly when givers outnumber recipients than it increases the other way around. A behavioral economics model is proposed to show how people’s belief about the selfishness of other givers can account for the asymmetry of the two effects.},

Furthermore, one respondent giving a candidate a lower score than another respondent could nevertheless be the stronger supporter. We state formal assumptions about the nature of preferences and propose a novel probabilistic response mechanism by which respondents construct numerical scores heterogeneously when asked to represent their preferences in a numerical format.

  abstract = {Abstract Fairness perception and equality during social interactions frequently elicit affective arousal and affect decision making. By integrating the dictator game and a probabilistic gambling task, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a negative experience induced by perceived unfairness on decision making using behavioral, model fitting, and electrophysiological approaches. Participants were randomly assigned to the neutral, harsh, or kind groups, which consisted of various asset allocation scenarios to induce different levels of perceived unfairness. The monetary gain was subsequently considered the initial asset in a negatively rewarded, probabilistic gambling task in which the participants were instructed to maintain as much asset as possible. Our behavioral results indicated that the participants in the harsh group exhibited increased levels of negative emotions but retained greater total game scores than the participants in the other two groups. Parameter estimation of a reinforcement learning model using a Bayesian approach indicated that these participants were more loss aversive and consistent in decision making. Data from simultaneous ERP recordings further demonstrated that these participants exhibited larger feedback-related negativity to unexpected outcomes in the gambling task, which suggests enhanced reward sensitivity and signaling of reward prediction error. Collectively, our study suggests that a negative experience may be an advantage in the modulation of reward-based decision making.},

We design a public goods game experiment in which actors elect leaders to make decisions on their behalf in the contribution to public goods. In particular, we compare the leadership elected from direct and indirect election systems. In direct election, a leader is elected directly by majority-votes from a group, whereas in indirect election the group is divided into smaller subgroups and a leader is elected from the elected subgroup leaders. We run a simulation model to show that direct election would choose a more cooperative leader than indirect election when voters’ preferences of leadership are not homogenous. A laboratory experiment with human subjects further indicates that people hold stronger preferences for cooperators as leaders in direct election than in indirect election, suggesting that the voting scheme has an effect not only on the processing of actors’ preferences, but also on the shaping of their preferences of leadership in the public goods dilemma.},

  abstract = {Emotional experience has a pervasive impact on choice behavior, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Introducing facial-expression primes into a probabilistic learning task, we investigated how affective arousal regulates reward-related choice based on behavioral, model fitting, and feedback-related negativity (FRN) data. Sixty-six paid subjects were randomly assigned to the Neutral-Neutral (NN), Angry-Neutral (AN), and Happy-Neutral (HN) groups. A total of 960 trials were conducted. Subjects in each group were randomly exposed to half trials of the pre-determined emotional faces and another half of the neutral faces before choosing between two cards drawn from two decks with different assigned reward probabilities. Trial-by-trial data were fit with a standard reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. The temporal dynamics of brain activity were simultaneously recorded and analyzed using event-related potentials. Our analyses revealed that subjects in the NN group gained more reward values than those in the other two groups; they also exhibited comparatively differential estimated model-parameter values for reward prediction errors. Computing the difference wave of FRNs in reward vs. non-reward trials, we found that, compared to the NN group, subjects in the AN and HN groups had larger “General” FRNs (i.e., FRNs in no-reward trials minus FRNs in reward trials) and “Expected” FRNs (i.e., FRNs in expected reward-omission trials minus FRNs in expected reward-delivery trials), indicating an interruption in predicting reward. Further, both AN and HN groups appeared to be more sensitive to negative outcomes than the NN group. Collectively, our study suggests that affective arousal negatively regulates reward-related choice, probably through overweighting with negative feedback.},

  abstract = {The study of thresholds for discriminability has been of long-standing interest in psychophysics. While threshold theories embrace the concept of discrete-state thresholds, signal detection theory discounts such a concept. In this paper we concern ourselves with the concept of thresholds from the discrete-state modelling viewpoint. In doing so, we find it necessary to clarify some fundamental issues germane to the psychometric function (PF), which is customarily constructed using psychophysical methods with a binary-response format. We challenge this response format and argue that response confidence also plays an important role in the construction of PFs, and thus should have some impact on threshold estimation. We motivate the discussion by adopting a three-state threshold theory for response confidence proposed by Krantz (1969, Psychol. Rev., 76, 308–324), which is a modification of Luce's (1963, Psychol. Rev., 70, 61–79) low-threshold theory. In particular, we discuss the case in which the practice of averaging over order (or position) is enforced in data collection. Finally, we illustrate the fit of the Luce–Krantz model to data from a line-discrimination task with response confidence.},

Experimental data were fit by a reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. We also correlated subjects' performance with their personality traits assessed by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Matching law analysis revealed that males are more sensitive than females, meaning that males are better than females in choosing the advantageous card. Model fitting together with Bayes factors revealed that females update their values slightly faster than males, indicating that females have the tendency to give the trial-by-trial prediction error more weight. Further, females showed less perseveration than males, indicating that females tend to explore the uncertainty of future events more often. We also found that females' learning rate is negatively correlated with their task performance, whereas both males and females' degree of perseveration is positively correlated with their task scores. These results indicate that on average, males have a more 'optimal' learning rate and a larger degree of perseveration than females, providing a plausible explanation of why males performed slightly better than females in the task. Regarding the relation of task performance and personality traits, correlational analysis revealed that females with higher scores in ＂extravagance＂ (which is in the novelty-seeking dimension of TPQ) have lower value-updating rates. Moreover, females with higher scores in ＂attachment＂ (which is in the reward-dependence dimension of TPQ) have lower degrees of perseveration. No such findings were found in males. Further work is needed to verify the findings.

  abstract = {Abnormalities in the dopamine system have long been implicated in explanations of reinforcement learning and psychosis. The updated reward prediction error (RPE)—a discrepancy between the predicted and actual rewards—is thought to be encoded by dopaminergic neurons. Dysregulation of dopamine systems could alter the appraisal of stimuli and eventually lead to schizophrenia. Accordingly, the measurement of RPE provides a potential behavioral index for the evaluation of brain dopamine activity and psychotic symptoms. Here, we assess two features potentially crucial to the RPE process, namely belief formation and belief perseveration, via a probability learning task and reinforcement-learning modeling. Forty-five patients with schizophrenia [26 high-psychosis and 19 low-psychosis, based on their p1 and p3 scores in the positive-symptom subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)] and 24 controls were tested in a feedback-based dynamic reward task for their RPE-related decision making. While task scores across the three groups were similar, matching law analysis revealed that the reward sensitivities of both psychosis groups were lower than that of controls. Trial-by-trial data were further fit with a reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. Model fitting results indicated that both psychosis groups tend to update their reward values more rapidly than controls. Moreover, among the three groups, high-psychosis patients had the lowest degree of choice perseveration. Lumping patients' data together, we also found that patients' perseveration appears to be negatively correlated (p = 0.09, trending toward significance) with their PANSS p1 + p3 scores. Our method provides an alternative for investigating reward-related learning and decision making in basic and clinical settings.},

An example is the three-category weighted up–down (WUD) method (Kaernbach, 2001) and its four-category extension (Klein, 2001). Such an extension, however, is somewhat restricted, and in this paper we discuss its limitations. To facilitate the discussion, we characterize the extension of WUD by an algorithm that incorporates response confidence into a family of adaptive methods. This algorithm can also be applied to two other adaptive methods, namely Derman's up–down method and the biased-coin design, which are suitable for estimating any threshold quantiles. We then discuss via simulations of the above three methods the limitations of the algorithm. To illustrate, we conduct a small scale of experiment using the extended WUD under different response confidence formats to evaluate the consistency of threshold estimation.},

  abstract  = {The main symptom of dementia is the degradation of memory. In clinical settings the common approach to assess the functioning of memory is to take memory tests based on recall and recognition. However, such tests hardly reveal the underlying causes of memory degradation, because scores of these tests typically are not results of a single cognitive process but are influenced by several cognitive processes such as storage and retrieval. In this paper we introduce a cognitive modeling approach called ”multinomial processing tree models” to the clinical psychology community in Taiwan. This model assumes that the memory process consists of unstored, intermediate, and long-term states. The transition among the three states follows a discrete-state Markovian learning process, with the respective probabilities of storage and retrieval being characterized by some parameters. We illustrate the use of the model to clinical data collected from National Taiwan University Hospital, including Alzheimer's disease, early-onset dementia, senile dementia, mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, and organic brain syndrome. To assess the within-group heterogeneity commonly seen in clinical settings, we also incorporate a latent class analysis into the model. Parameter estimates via goodness-of-fit using the computer program HMMTree reveal that different types of dementia undergo somewhat differentiable deficits of storage and/or retrieval processes in the immediate and long-term states. We also discuss two limitations of the current study, namely the representativeness of the sample and the restriction of the HMMTree program.

Given the importance of dopamine in reward learning and the involvement of Akt1 in dopamine-dependent behaviors, the aim of this study was to investigate whether Akt1 deficiency modulates reward learning and the magnitude of RPE using Akt1 mutant mice as a model. In comparison to wild-type littermate controls, the expression of Akt1 proteins in mouse brains occurred in a gene-dosage-dependent manner and Akt1 heterozygous (HET) mice exhibited impaired striatal Akt1 activity under methamphetamine challenge. No genotypic difference was found in the basal levels of dopamine and its metabolites. In a series of reward-related learning tasks, HET mice displayed a relatively efficient method of updating reward information from the environment during the acquisition phase of the two natural reward tasks and in the reverse section of the dynamic foraging T-maze but not in methamphetamine-induced or aversive-related reward learning. The implementation of a standard reinforcement learning model and the Bayesian hierarchical parameter estimation show that HET mice have higher RPE magnitudes and that their action values are updated more rapidly among all three test sections in T-maze. These results indicate that Akt1 deficiency modulates natural reward learning and RPE. This study showed a promising avenue for investigating RPE in mutant mice and provided evidence for the potential link from genetic deficiency, to neurobiological abnormalities, to impairment in higher-order cognitive functioning.},

Experiment 1 found individual differences in decision strategies when we did not control relative saliency.

In this paper, we examine a more general affine representation, P(x,y)=F(u(x)h(y)+g(y)). We first obtain a uniqueness theorem for the affine representation. We then study the conditions that force an affine representation to degenerate to a subtractive one. Part of that study involves the case for which two different affine representations co-exist for the same data. We also show that the balance condition P(x,y)+P(y,x)=1 constrains an affine representation to be a special kind of subtractive representation, a Fechnerian one. We further show that Falmagne’s power law takes on a special form for a so-called weakly balanced system of probabilities, in which case the affine representation is Fechnerian. Finally, following Iverson [Iverson, G.J. (2006a). Analytical methods in the theory of psychophysical discrimination I: Inequalities, convexity and integration of just noticeable differences.

  abstract  = {In psychophysical research of detection and discrimination, non-parametric adaptive methods, including the fixed and non-fixed step-size methods, have been used extensively for threshold estimation through a combination of decreasing and increasing stimulus steps (see Leek, 2001; Treutwein, 1995, for reviews). In recent years, researchers have focused on the asymptotic and small-sample properties of some of the methods via computer simulations (e. g., Faes et al., 2007; Garcia-Perez, 1998, 2001). In this article we systematically investigate via simulations the large-and small-sample properties of some of the non-parametric adaptive methods in the yes-no detection task. The convergence for different starting values, relative step sizes, and response criteria is systematically investigated. The results show that in both the large- and small-sample conditions, the accelerated stochastic approximation (ASA) (Kesten, 1958) performs well with medium to large (initial) step size. A fixed-step-size method called the biased coin design (BCD) (Durham & Flournoy, 1993, 1995) with small step size is also recommended. Furthermore, our simulation results show that for small sample size, it is also feasible to apply ASA first, then followed by BCD in the sequence as the combined method.

In recent years, researchers have investigated via simulations some asymptotic and small-sample properties of two nonparametric adaptive methods—namely, the fixed-step-size up-down (García-Pérez, 1998, 2001) and the (accelerated) stochastic approximation (Faes et al., 2007). In the present article, we extend both methods to the simple reaction time (RT) situation for the measure of signal intensities that elicit certain (fixed) RT percentiles. We focus on extending the following four methods: the stochastic approximation of Robbins and Monro (1951), its accelerated version of Kesten (1958), the transformed up-down of Wetherill (1963), and the “biased coin design” of Durham and Flournoy (1994, 1995). In all simulations, we assume that the RT is Weibull distributed and that there is a linear relationship between the mean RT and its standard deviation.

The states of the random walk coincide with those of the medium, and the transitions of the random walk are governed by a probability distribution on the set of token-events, together with a Poisson process regulating the arrivals of such events. We examine two special cases. The first is the medium on strict weak orders on a set of three elements, the second the medium of strict partial orders on the same set. Thus, in each of these cases, a state of the medium is a binary relation. We also consider tune in-and-out extensions of these two special cases. We review applications of these models to opinion poll data pertaining to the 1992 United States presidential election. Each strict weak order or strict partial order is interpreted as being the implicit or explicit opinion of some individual regarding the three major candidates in that election, namely, Bush, Clinton and Perot. In particular, the strict partial order applications illustrate our notion of a response function that provides the link between theory and data in situations where, in contrast to previous papers, the permissible responses do not span the entire set of permissible states of the medium.},

Successful applications of some weak order implementations of stochastic media theory to 1992 U.S. National Election Study (NES) panel data have been reported by Falmagne and various collaborators. However, past attempts to fit a semiorder model to the same data have failed. We successfully fit four media theoretic models, including two semiorder models based on the ”neighboring” response mechanism, to 1992, 1996, and 2000 NES panel data. We compare the fit of these four models, discuss the psychological interpretation of key model parameters and illustrate applications to negative political campaigning.},

In particular, consistent estimates of β are obtained. However, this law offers no information regarding the effect of the signal intensity on other aspects of the reaction time distribution. In addition, the background intensity, which also has some impact on the detectability of the signal, is not considered in Piéron's law. In this paper, we generalize Piéron's law based on the above comments. That is, we assume that both β and C are functions of the background intensity and of the percentile rank. We then investigate from a theoretical viewpoint some possible functional forms of β and C, with a special emphasis on the dependency of β on the background intensity. It is shown that the so-called “Fechner–Thurstone-type representation” forces β and C to be “separable.” If we further assume a near-miss to Weber's law-type representation, then the functional form of β can be determined.},

We present a generalization of Falmagne et al.'s model based on the idea that some individuals may become momentarily impervious to all matters related to the campaign and ‘tune out.’ This behavior could be triggered by some personal reason or by some external event related to the campaign. Like the original model, the resulting model is a random walk, but on an augmented set of states. A respondent in a ‘live’ state behaves as in the previous model, except when receiving a ‘tune-out’ token, which effectively freezes the respondent's preference state until it is reversed by a ‘tune-in’ token. We describe and successfully test the new model on the same 1992 National Election Study panel data as those used by Böckenholt (2002) and Regenwetter et al. (1999).},

However, the model is not precise enough to reveal the relation between the signal intensity and the ‘cut-off’. Accordingly, Kornblum's model is extended with an emphasis on the measure of the ‘cut-off’. Another aspect of the extension is to use a parametric method to analyse the data. In particular, it is assumed that the time estimation-induced latency is gamma distributed and the signal-induced latency is Weibull distributed, with the latter shifted by the ‘cut-off’. The rationale behind the parametric assumption is discussed. For illustrative purposes, two pieces of experimental work are presented. Since the core of the race model is the assumption of an independent race between the time estimation process and the detection process, the first experiment tests whether, for the same signal intensity, the signal-induced latency distribution is invariant across different time intervals; the second experiment tests whether, for the same time interval, the time estimation-induced latency distribution is invariant across different signal intensity conditions. The data from the second experiment are also used to test various parametric assumptions in the model, which include the signal effect on the ‘cut-off’. The new model fits the data well.},

Such a model should also spell out how hypothetical constructs relate to observable behavior, such as feeling thermometer ratings. The chapter reviews response processes that, in some cases, accommodate within and across respondent heterogeneity in overt behavior. The model should furthermore specify formally what it means to change one’s preference over time and how that change relates to the persuasive environment. The chapter treats preference change as a continuous time stochastic process on a graph of preference states. The most innovative feature of the approach is to model the (perceived) persuasive environment itself also as a hypothetical construct that is not directly/objectively observable by the researcher. Last but not least, the chapter discusses how to accommodate partisan differences, how to incorporate respondents with immutable preferences, and the possibility that respondents may tune in and out of a persuasive campaign.

  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {This article reexamines the previous debate on Quoidbach et al.’s (2014) entropy-based emodiversity index and evaluates its utility from theoretical and empirical aspects. We mainly focus on the consequences of applying Shannon’s (1948) entropy to Likert-type scale. From the previous debate, we extend and summarize two severe defects of the entropy-based emodiversity index: (a) calculating probability from Likert-type scale is mathematically unjustifiable; (b) there is extremely high collinearity between the entropy index and richness when the emotion measurement has limited range, which usually occurs in empirical studies. We also collected data (N = 962) and analyzed the entropy scores for positive and negative affect under 5-point scale with different numbers of items (5-, 10-, and 20-item). The results showed that under 5-point scale Quoidbach et al.’s index is strongly correlated with richness (rs ranged from .94 to .98) and that the variation of their index can be simply explained by the linear combination of mean, relative standard deviation, and their interaction term (R2s ranged from .78 to .92). Hence, the validity of using entropy to measure diversity in a 5-point scale is questionable and we advise researchers to prohibit the use of this index to represent emodiversity.
Quoidbach等人（2014）採用資訊理論與生物多樣性研究常用的熵（Shannon’s entropy）來測量個體的情緒多樣性（emodiversity）。雖然曾有學者反對採用該指標來表徵情緒多樣性，但該指標仍在心理學研究中被廣泛使用。本文先探討以往對熵指標在情緒多樣性的辯論，並以實徵資料來重新評估用熵作為情緒多樣性的合理性。本研究更延伸出以往辯論較忽略的兩大缺陷：（一）該指標以李克式量尺（Likert-type scale）計算機率並無理論基礎；（二）在實徵研究常用的李克式量尺點數（例如5點至7點）下，該指標與情緒豐富度（richness）有極高的線性關聯。在實徵資料（N = 962）中，本研究分析在五點李克式量尺中不同題目數（5、10與20題）下正負向情緒之熵指標，也發現熵與情緒豐富度有極高的線性關聯（rs = .94 - .98）。此外，熵的變異可被平均數、相對標準差及二者交互作用之線性組合良好解釋（解釋變異量介於78%至92%）。這些結果皆顯示利用熵指標測量情緒多樣性仍有其效度上的疑慮。因此本文建議，當情緒是以五點李克式量尺測量時，研究者不應採用熵指標測量情緒多樣性，且該指標主要以其平均數跟相對標準差即可指稱之。},

  title    = {The influence of combination of response confidence scale with adaptive methods in threshold estimation experiments},
  year     = {2019},
  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {In a threshold estimation experiment, the threshold is commonly estimated by adaptive methods. These experiments are based on binary responses (Yes/No). However, there are some limitations of binary responses that could affect the results of experiments. To solve this problem, scholars have tried to include the role of response confidence in the experiment by extending the number of category of responses (Hsu & Chin, 2014; Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001). Following this idea, in this thesis I used simulation to survey the influence of introducing a continuous response confidence scale to different adaptive methods (including the Weighted Up-Down method, Biased Coin Design, and Derman''s Up-Down method) in two types of threshold experiments (Yes/No tasks and Same/Difference tasks). Moreover, I systematically manipulated the initial value, step size, trial number and other experiment variables to discuss their influences on adaptive methods. The simulation results show that the performance of the Weighted Up-Down method is better than the other two adaptive methods. Note that the placement of cut-offs on the response confidence scale might affect the performance of adaptive methods, and in some cases leads to the emergence of biases. We show that these biases can be reduced or even eliminated by adjusting some experiment variables. To summarize, the introduction of the response confidence scale can provide researchers with more freedom on experimental design, and there exists reasonable solutions to reduce the potential biases generated by this scale.
在一個閾值實驗裡閾值通常以適測方法估計；這些實驗是基於二選項回答（「是」/「否」），但二選項回答所帶來的一些限制會影響實驗結果。為解決此問題，學者試圖通過擴展回答選項個數的方式將回答信心包含進實驗裡（Hsu & Chin, 2014; Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001）。跟隨該研究方向，在這篇論文裡，我採用電腦模擬探討在兩種實驗（「是」/「否」作業與「同」/「異」作業）情境中引入一個連續回答信心量尺對不同適測方法（適測方法包含帶權重上下法、偏差硬幣投擲法與德爾曼上下法）的影響。更進一步地，我經由系統性地操作初始值、步長、試驗數等實驗變量探討它們對適測方法的影響。模擬結果表明帶權重上下法整體比另兩個適測方法表現好。值得注意的是，回答信心量尺的截點位置會影響適測方法的表現，且在一些條件下會引發偏誤的出現。我們研究表明通過調整實驗變量可以減小甚至消除這些偏誤。綜上，在閾值實驗裡引入回答信心量尺可給予研究者在實驗設計階段更多的自由，其附帶偏誤亦存在合理解決方式以減小其影響。},

  abstract = {Affective experience pervades our daily life and it usually brings out pronounce impact on our judgment and decision making. However, after decades of research in the fields of social psychology, organizational psychology, and cognitive neuroscience, the mechanisms contributing to this pronounce impact is yet debating. To provide more formative indices to the existing descriptive models and to link them to more concrete neurophysiological substrates, we have examined the affective influences on decision making under the framework of reinforcement learning theory. Specifically, we followed the definition from Loewenstein and Lerner (2003) and examined the impacts of incidental and integral affects on reward-based decision making in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. In Study 1, the incidental affect or mood state was induced through introducing different facial expressions (i.e., neutral, angry, and happy) into a probabilistic gambling task. By contrast, in Study 2, the integral affect or emotional experience was elicited through manipulating different levels of perceived unfairness in a modified dictator game preceding a probabilistic gambling task. The choice behavior data from the probabilistic gambling task in the two studies were fit with a reinforcement learning model (Sutton & Barto, 1998; Li et al., 2014) to retrieve the parameters that help us to uncover the mental processes underlying decision making. Also, in each experimental condition, the concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) data were analyzed to retrieve the event-related potentials (ERP) that reflect the neural signaling of reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and actual action outcomes. In addition, the schizophrenic patients are characterized with deficient reward processing and attenuated affective response, and it is of interest to investigate the altered affective influence in this population. Hence, in Study 3, we modified the design of Study 1 and applied it to chronic schizophrenic patients. This is an exploratory research and we set to investigate the potential interaction between deficient reward processing and aberrant affective activity (i.e, expression recognition) in this population, as these two factors might contribute together to the disrupted social function and poor life quality in schizophrenia. Findings of this study shall contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying affect-elicited decision making in schizophrenia.
我們的日常生活中充滿著各種情緒活動經驗，而這些經驗通常都會為決策與判斷帶來深遠的影響。過去數十年間，各領域研究的研究者們中對於情緒化決策相關議題的探索累積了豐碩的研究成果，也提出了許多結構化分類與描述現象的理論架構，但這些現象背後的機制卻仍在爭議當中。為了替這些敘述性的理論提供更明確的量測指標，並且賦予具體的神經生理基礎，我們將對於情緒化決策歷程的探討連結到增強學習理論 (reinforcement learning theory; Sutton & Barto, 1998) 的架構之中，並依循 Loewenstein 與 Lerner (2003) 的定義將情緒活動區分成伴隨性情緒 (incidental affect) 與整合性情緒 (integral affect)，分別於研究一與研究二中探討兩種情緒活動對於酬賞基礎決策 (reward-based decision making) 歷程的影響。在研究一當中，我們以中性、生氣、與高興三種不同的臉孔表情做為促發刺激嵌入機率博弈作業 (probabilistic gambling task) 當中，操弄受試者在作業過程中的伴隨性情緒活動；而在研究二當中，我們則是安排受試者在進行機率博弈作業之前先參與一個修改過後的獨裁者遊戲，並於其中操弄不同程度的分配不公平性，以引發受試者間不同的整合性情緒經驗。受試者於機率博弈作業當中的選擇行為資料以增強學習模型 (Sutton & Barto, 1998; Li, Lai, Liu, & Hsu, 2014) 配適，藉此提取與決策判斷歷程有關的模型估計參數；而實驗過程中所記錄到的腦波活動資料 (electroencephalogram, EEG) 也分析提取成事件關聯電位 (event-related potential, ERP)，以反映酬賞預測誤差 (reward-prediction error, RPE)－預期結果與實際結果之間的差距－所引發的神經活動。綜合行為、模型參數估計、以及神經生理指標量測的結果，我們發現伴隨性情緒活動與整合性情緒經驗對決策歷程的影響不盡相同，並且分別對應到不同的現行理論架構，我們將其彙整討論於最後一章。另外，文獻指出思覺失調症 (schizophrenia) 患者在酬賞處理與情緒辨識上皆有著明顯缺損，然而兩者之間的關係卻鮮少被討論，於是在研究三中我們便將研究一的設計修改後應用於這群患者上。結果顯示，在酬賞處理與情緒辨識的異常表現之餘，患者們的情緒活動對於決策力將的調節效果也明顯低於健康對照組。結合過去文獻，我們主張情緒與決策共同反應著重要的社會功能面向，而對於情緒化決策缺損的探討可增進我們對思覺失調症患者社會功能障礙的了解。},

  abstract = {Equality and fairness in social interaction often elicit affective arousal and show a great impact on decision making. The present study aims to un- cover the mechanism behind such daily-life experiences using the behavioral, model-fitting, and electrophysiological approaches. In the first session of the experiment, Sixty-three paid participants were randomly assigned to one of the “Neutral,” “Harsh,” and “Kind” groups to undertake a different level of perceived fairness. Then a probabilistic gambling task with different proba- bilities of negative-reward assignments was applied to each participant to ex- amine the impact of emotional experience on her choice behavior. Altogether the procedures lasted about two hours. Trial-by-trial data were fitted by a hybrid reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. Brain activities were measured via event-related potentials. Our analyses re- vealed that, compared with other two groups, participants in the Harsh group retained more task scores, exhibited distinct parameter values of the reinforce- ment learning model, and demonstrated a larger feedback-related negativity to unexpected outcomes, suggesting a higher sensitivity to prediction error and a tendency to loss aversion.
人生中，我們常因一些外在因素影響自身的心情，例如比較的心態、或是面對生活中各種不公不義，進而影響決策的判斷。本篇研究利用兩階段的實驗設計，藉由數理模型、事件關聯電位揭露情緒對於行為決策影響。受試者首先面臨「命運遊戲」，63位受試者隨機分派到「仁慈組」、「中立組」或是「苛刻組」。每組在過程中受試者會被迫接受一系列的資產分配，覺察其中分配的公平性，進而產生對應的情緒。從「命運遊戲」中所獲得的資產，將為第二階段「機會遊戲」的起始籌碼。「機會遊戲」是一連串的二選一選牌遊戲，同回合呈現的兩張牌會有不同的機率被扣資產。受試者的遊戲目的為最大化自己的總資產，實驗長度約莫兩小時。分析方法上，我們以反饋負波來量測與「預測錯誤」有關之情緒反應，並採用貝氏方法之增強學習模型分析行為資料。結果發現「苛刻組」於「機會遊戲」保留的總資產最高，他們的「非預期」反饋負波值較其他兩組為大。另外，在模型參數表現上他們有較高的趨避損失傾向、較低的即時更新速率、以及較高的選擇一致性。},

  year     = {2012},
  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {In the psychophysical research field, detection or discrimination thresholds can be estimated by non-parametric adaptive procedures. The two-alternative forced-choice paradigm is commonly used for the experiment. In this paradigm, participants have to choose the alternative that contains the target stimulus. Recently, some researchers conducted psychophysical experiments using non-parametric adaptive procedures that incorporate the confidence rating of responses from participants. The efficiency of thresholds and parameters estimations was enhanced by the confidence rating of responses (Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001; Garcia-Perez, 2010).
In this thesis, the weighted up-down procedure, a non-parametric adaptive procedure, was used to conduct experiments. Two response tools - keyboard and visual analogue scale — and the confidence rating of two-, three-, and four-response options were used to collect responses, comparing the efficiency of discrimination threshold estimations among different options of the confidence rating. We also used a non-adaptive procedure to measure the thresholds and tested the consistency of threshold estimations between the non-adaptive and weighted up-down procedures.
To conclude, threshold estimations by the weighted up-down procedure were biased compared to the estimations by the non-adaptive procedure. And this result was consistent with previous simulation studies. The results in the weighted up-down procedure showed that tasks with three-, and four-response options were more efficient methods on estimating thresholds than the task with the two-response option. Moreover, threshold estimations by the visual analogue scale were inconsistent with those with keyboard, unless the former was incorporated with more response options of confidence rating.
在心理物理學中，無母數適測方法可應用於測量偵測與區辨閾值。在閾值研究中，多數研究使用兩選項強迫選擇作業(2-alternative forced-choice paradigm)，配合此作業，受試者必須從兩個選項之中強迫選出包含目標刺激者或刺激強度較大者。近來，有一些學者開始討論配合無母數適測方法進行實驗，且提供受試者更多的反應選項來收集受試者對反應的信心，透過收集反應的信心能夠增進閾值或參數估計的效率(Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001; Garcia-Perez, 2010)。
在本篇研究中，將選用無母數適測方法中之「上下加權調整法」(weighted up-down procedure)進行實驗，並使用反應工具─鍵盤或視覺類比量尺(visual analogue scale)─配合兩、三或四點之反應信心量尺來估計區辨閾值，比較不同反應信心量尺之閾值估計效率。另一方面，本篇研究也使用預先選定刺激強度之非適測方法進行閾值估計，用以比較上下加權調整法與非適測方法兩者在不同反應信心量尺中閾值估計的一致性。
結果顯示，以非適測方法估計結果為基準，上下加權調整法在不同反應信心量尺中，閾值估計都有些微偏差，支持過去模擬研究之結論。另外，單看上下加權調整法在不同反應信心量尺中之閾值估計，結果顯示，三或四點之反應信心量尺在估計效率上些微勝過兩點。最後，視覺類比量尺作為反應工具需要配合較多點數之反應信心量尺，才能得到與鍵盤反應一致之估計結果。},

  year     = {2012},
  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {Making appropriate decisions involves the ability to update information of alternatives from previous experiences. In particular, the updated reward prediction error (RPE) – a discrepancy between the predicted and the actual rewards, is regarded as being encoded by dopamine neurons. Two issues about RPE were discussed in this thesis. First, dysfunction of RPE might link abnormal dopamine systems and therefore the formation of psychotic symptoms (i.e., hallucination and delusion) in schizophrenia (SZ). To examine this hypothesis, we tested SZ patients and healthy controls using a feedback-based “dynamic rewarding task,” in which the subject was required to choose between two different reward options that were alternated in a block fashion. We fit the experimental data with a (standard) reinforcement learning (RL) model using the Bayesian estimation approach. Model-fitting results revealed that SZ patients update their values more rapidly and have more exploratory decisions. We also found that the degree of exploration increases with the severity of the psychotic symptoms. These findings support the hypothesis that abnormal RPE processes correlate with aberrant dopaminergic activities and subjective psychotic experiences. Second, since an individual’s heritable trait might predispose her/his decision-making behavior, we conducted a Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire on subjects to investigate the correlation between personality traits and the estimated parameters in the RL model. Results showed that college students with higher novelty seeking scores have lower value-updating rates, and those with higher reward dependence scores have higher degree of explorations. Moreover, gender differences were found in the task performance. However, no similar patterns were found in SZ patients. Finally, we briefly discussed two modeling issues that are yet to be resolved. The first concerns the negative correlation between the learning rate parameter and the perseveration parameter in the RL model. The second concerns the issue of scale invariance with regard to the perseveration parameter in the RL model.
動物與人在不確定性環境中決策皆需經由試誤學習才能學習到環境的規則，對環境形成預期並依此作為未來決策的依據。根據增強學習理論的假設，預期的更新發生於預期與實際經驗之間有落差時，該落差被稱為酬賞預測誤差（reward prediction error, RPE）。當研究發現多巴胺細胞能夠記錄RPE訊號，RPE在神經科學的研究開始興起。本研究包含兩個議題，分別探討（i）精神分裂症病人（schizophrenia, SZ）的精神病症狀與RPE之關係，（ii）個體在性格上的差異是否影響RPE的處理歷程。首先，有學者認為多巴胺系統異常導致RPE處理錯誤是SZ病人產生精神病症狀（例如：幻覺與妄想）的原因。為檢驗該假設，本研究讓SZ病人進行以兩選項之機率學習的回饋性決策—動態酬賞作業，在作業中得到酬賞機率大的選項每過一段時間會改變，而且該改變不會告知受試者。本研究使用增強學習模型來分析資料，參數估計使用貝氏估計法。研究發現SZ病人更新預期的速度比較快且有較多探索性決策。此外，隨著病人的精神病症狀越嚴重，則會有越多的探索性決策。這些研究結果與假設相符。研究的第二部份分析Cloninger之三向度性格量表各向度得分與動態酬賞作業表現的相關，結果發現一般大學生在動態酬賞作業的表現存在性別差異，而且新奇追求傾向越高者其更新預期的速度越慢，酬賞依賴傾向越高者其探索性決策越多。然而，在SZ病人並無發現類似的結果。另外，本研究也約略討論增強學習模型的參數性質，包括參數間的相關性與單位不變性。},

  title    = {Impact of different kinds of attention on perceptual-based sequence learning},
  year     = {2012},
  type     = {mathesis},
  abstract = {It is known that sequence learning involves attention-modulated implicit and/or explicit processes (Nissen and Bullemer, 1987). The pure perceptual-based sequence learning task (Remillard, 2009) which employs the probabilistic structure of visual stimulus, has demonstrated that visual-spatial attention could affect sequence learning. But that task did not specify the kinds of attention responsible for the impairment of sequence learning. Caparos and Linnell (2009) indicated that there is a gradient effect of attention under low perceptual load. The closer the distractor is to the target, the more the attention is consumed. This study used distractors from high- and low-successive frequencies and manipulated two attentional factors, namely distance and randomness, to investigate their impact on perceptual-based learning. Remillard’s paradigm (2009) is employed and the results was replicated. In the second experiment, the various distances of distractors to the targets were manipulated, and the results revealed that only the short-same-color distraction group impaired learning, and the others did not. This result supports the visual-spatial attention account. In the last experiment, the randomness of distractors to the targets was manipulated, and the results revealed that the random-long-same-color distraction group impaired learning. This result supports the attention-independent associative account. The three experiments indicated that perceptual-based sequence learning is affected differently by the characters of attention in the different condition.
序列學習（sequence learning）(Nissen & Bullemer, 1987）研究在過去一直有顯式、隱式兩種不同歷程的解釋；而其作業測量結果也受刺激結構及不同注意力影響。純知覺基礎序列學習（pure perceptual-based sequence learning）(Remillard, 2009）作業操弄機率型刺激結構，其研究結果藉由排除其它注意力假說，而支持該作業結果受視空間注意力所影響。Caparos與Linnell (2009) 認為視空間注意力在低知覺負荷下，其干擾物對注意力的影響會有階梯（gradient）性效應；干擾物離目標物越近，越消耗注意力。有鑑於此，本研究首先操弄干擾物與目標物的距離差異，再操弄干擾物的隨機程度差異，藉以探討不同注意力變項對知覺序列學習作業的影響。實驗一採用Remillard (2009) 的作業派典，其結果發現，在同顏色組沒有發生隱式序列學習，而在不同顏色組則發生隱式序列學習，複驗了過去的研究。實驗二操弄同顏色干擾物的長、短距離，發現在短距離-同顏色干擾物組沒有發生隱式序列學習，而在長距離-同顏色干擾物組有發生隱式序列學習。此結果說明不同距離對知覺序列學習作業有影響，支持視空間注意力假說。實驗三操弄長距離-同顏色干擾物的隨機位置，發現沒有發生隱式序列學習。此結果說明關聯性注意力對知覺序列學習作業也有影響。本篇研究說明純知覺基礎序列學習作業的隱式序列學習表現，在不同條件下會受到不同注意力的影響。},
